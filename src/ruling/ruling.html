      <h2 class="md-title">About Social Security Tax</h2>
      <p>
        The current criteria for determining the Social Security Tax is as follows:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Get the Tax Base for the previous year (in this case {{$ctrl.year - 1}}) - which is Previous Year Gross Income * {{$ctrl.nominalExpenseRates[$ctrl.year-1]}}</li>
        <li>To that, add all the Social Tax paid in the previous year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Subtract 25% of that sum.</b>
        </li>
        <li>This is now the basis for calculating the Social Tax for year {{$ctrl.year}}. We multiply this base with 0.382 (38.2%) to get the total Yearly Social Tax to be paid this year.
        </li>
        <li><b>However, this tax has a minimum and maximum, so it cannot be lower than 4264.32€/year or higher than 25424.52€/year as of {{$ctrl.year}}.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
